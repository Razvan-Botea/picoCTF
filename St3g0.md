# Description

Download this image and find the flag.

# Solution

- we get a .png file
- opening it we see a picture of the picoCTF logo
- zooming and looking around the image reveals nothing
- using grep on the hex data also gives us nothing
- we can try using a steganography tool to find any secret messages
	- i used https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg

# Flag

- **picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_96ae0ac1}$t3g0**
