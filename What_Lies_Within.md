# Description

There's something in the [building](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_fickle_tempest/c0eec6af0f04316e2bdc4a9f095afd0e2d0121f5e543dbc4a65bb0038d72a993/buildings.png). Can you retrieve the flag?

# Solution

- we get a .png file 
- there is nothing immediately obvious in the picture
- using the tool https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg, we get the flag

!! We can also use an online tool to find messages hidden in images. I like to use https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/

# Flag

- **picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}**
